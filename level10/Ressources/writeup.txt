- level10's home contains level10 binary and a token file

- the binary read from the file argv[1] and send it to the host argv[2]:6969

- the binary calls access to verify if the calling process have read access to the file
after that comes the call to open

- we will perform a race condition attack, basically when access is called we need to argv[1]
to be a file we read access to then when open is called argv[1] should be token.
We can achieve this by switching between a symbolic link /tmp/token pointing to token
and /tmp/file. Hopefully the timing will be right and /tmp/file will be passed to access and
/tmp/token will be passed to token.

- We'll use rename system call to race
