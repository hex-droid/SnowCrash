- home folder contains level07 binary

- when executing it prints level07 after disassembling main the program calls getenv then asprintf then system

- the program prints the env variable LOGNAME with system because asprintf allocate the size of the second argument and it writes it into the first argument
we are left with system priting LOGNAME with echo

- we will inject code in LOGNAME env var, export LOGNAME="test; getflag"

we got our flag
