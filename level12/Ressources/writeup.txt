- we find level12.pl cgi script set-userid bit set, serving in route
/ of box_ip:4646

- cgi takes two query parameters x and y, x is the interesting one
because the cgi executes the egrep utility matching the value of 
uppercase x and whitespaces skipped

- let's create an executable script /tmp/SCRIPT that executes getflag
and redirects stdout to /tmp/flag

- in order to not uppercase tmp we send a wild card

- the payload will be `/*/SCRIPT`
