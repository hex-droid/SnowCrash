- Running file Command on level03 file gives "setuid setgid ELF 32-bit LSB executable"

- The mode s on User is set, meaning to set user id on execution,
and owner of the file is flag03

- The executable prints Exploit Me 

- Let's print the sequences of pritable characters in files with strings

- We found this string "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me" the program prints Exploit Me
with echo

- The echo call is done with relative path this means we can create our echo
and inject it's path into PATH enviroment variable

- This way we can execute getflag as flag03 using SUID mode, with our own echo that
executes getflag and writes it to /tmp/flag03
