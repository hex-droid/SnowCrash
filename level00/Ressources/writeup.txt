- Find all files owned by flag00: "find / -user flag00 2> /dev/null"

- I found this cipher "cdiiddwpgswtgt" in /usr/sbin/john it looks like a Caesar cipher

- I tried every possible key [0,25] to decipher (decipher(y) = y - key), with the help of caesar.py

- "nottoohardhere" was the most coherent, it's the password of flag00
